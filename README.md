This repo is specially created for all the work done by me as a part of Coursera's Machine Learning Course.

I have studied the class from 11/4/2017~11/20/2017. you may find some differences from your class and please pay attention to these.

You may find the quiz answers in reference repo under. There are some bugs in reference repo, and I have fixed and tested in my own repo.Thank you!
